# Demonstration, model and evaluation data 

For: *A Motion Capture and Imitation Learning-based Approach to Robot Control*

Contents:
- *processed_data*: training data with intermediate results, starting with the raw recording up to the training data sets with target coordinates and state transitions;
- *saved_models*: model weights and computation graphs saved in the training process;
- *validation*: model-generated trajectories combined with demonstrations that share the same initial conditions, for evaluation;
- *comparison_tables*: evaluation metrics computed on models by shared parameter.
